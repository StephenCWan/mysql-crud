mysql-crud
==========

Simple CRUD operations for felixge/node-mysql.

Mysql-crud dynamically creates an object that allows you to perform CRUD operations on the specified connection pool and table. Mysql-Crud is NOT an ORM. You cannot use it across multiple tables or for more complicated queries. It is meant to a be a short hand for simple INESRT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries on a single table.

##Usage:
In-order to create a crud-object you must called the mysql-crud function with two parameters: a mysql connection pool and the table name your object. Remember, mysql-crud only performs work on a single table.

```javascript
var mysql = require('mysql');                
var db = mysql.createPool();
var CRUD = require('mysql-crud');
var user-crud = CRUD(db, 'users');
//user-crud will now have the four functions
```

##Create

`create(attributes, callback)`

This function will perform the INSERT INTO query on the specified table. It will set the values equal to the first parameter and then call the callback. The callback is the standard mysql callback (err, and rows). 

```javascript
user-curd.create({'id' : 1, 'username' : 'test', 'password' : '1234'}, function (err, vals) {
	//mysql callback
});
```

##Load (Retreive)

`load(selector, callback)`

This function will SELECT all the rows that match the selector key-value. Multiple keys will be considered AND in the WHERE clause.

Example:
```javascript
user-crud.load({'first-name' : 'mysql', 'last-name' : 'crud'}, callback);
//SELECT * FROM 'users' WHERE 'first-name' = "mysql" AND 'last-name' = "CRUD"
```


##Update:

`update(selector, values, callback)`

This function will run the UPDATE query. It will update all rows where the selector is true to the values in the values object.

##Destroy

`destroy(selector, callback)`

This function will run the DELTE FROM query based on the selectors. Use with caution.


##Advanced Usage

If you are using the MVC model you can create custom functions or default values for your crud command:

```javascript
/*model/user.js*/
var db = require('your-database-pool.js');
var crud = require('crud')(db, 'users');

exports.create = function (attrs, callback) {
	if (attrs.password !== undefined) {
		attrs.password = hash(attrs.password);
	}
	crud(attrs, callback);
};
exports.load = crud.load;
exports.update = crud.update;
exports.destroy = crud.destroy;
```
